# odin-recipes
odin first project

we'll come back here after we're done w this project :)

ok we're done. it was pretty fun. we did some celticcup recipes and i mean yeah.
i felt pretty confident and i didnt really have any problems. i did learn about
the width and height attributes for images. that was sick. and i gotta get more used
to git but ya know. this is fire.
