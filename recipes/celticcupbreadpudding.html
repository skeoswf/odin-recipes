        <h3>description</h3>
        <p>the bread pudding is definitely one of my favorite things from the celtic cup. we save a lot of byproducts and stuff that the customers wouldnt
            want and/or would be hard to sell. for this recipe, we would use the bread heels from our loafs of breads. boss lady actually gave me the recipe
            from the kindness in her heart. or something like that. stale bread is <em>better</em> if you're buying bread just for this recipe. the butter
            rum sauce for it is SO fire, and topping it with candied pecans is like, man. id definitely wanna try different topping combinations though--
            like strawberry syrup and white chocolate chips or something. anyways. yeah this recipe is fire. trust. it sells super well.</p>
