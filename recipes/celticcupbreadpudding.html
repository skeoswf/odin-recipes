        <h3>description</h3>
        <p>the bread pudding is definitely one of my favorite things from the celtic cup. we save a lot of byproducts and stuff that the customers wouldnt
            want and/or would be hard to sell. for this recipe, we would use the bread heels from our loafs of breads. boss lady actually gave me the recipe
            from the kindness in her heart. or something like that. stale bread is <em>better</em> if you're buying bread just for this recipe. the butter
            rum sauce for it is SO fire, and topping it with candied pecans is like, man. id definitely wanna try different topping combinations though--
            like strawberry syrup and white chocolate chips or something. anyways. yeah this recipe is fire. trust. it sells super well.</p>

        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>11 ounces of stale white bread</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <p>-------</p>
            <li>4 oz butter</li>
            <p>-------</p>
            <li>3 1/2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups liquid eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt<li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>tear bread into rough 1/2 inch</li>
            <li>put bread pieces into rectangular baking pan. (ex. 9x14)</li>
                <p>do <em>not</em> use a flat baking pan</p>
            <li>pour 2 cups of milk over bread. let stand for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>melt butter in the microwave and then drizzle over milk/bread mixture</li>
            <li>in a bowl, mix remaining 3 1/2 cups milk, 2 cups liquid eggs, 2 cups sugar, 1 tsp salt, 
                and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>pour liquid mixture over bread, then let stand for 45ish minutes</li>
            <li>preheat oven to 325. we use a double pan method-- put the pan with the bread mixture into a bigger pan with 
                similar depth, and place hot water into the larger pan.</li>
                <p>tbh if i was at home making this i would just stick it without the double pan mess. but i guess itd be
                    better to do it anyways for equal heat distribution or something like that idk</p>
            <li>place the pans in the oven for 32 minutes.</li>
                <p>the recipe says 32 minutes im not too sure if it has to be <em>that</em> precise</p>
            <li>chill, and then cut into 12 squares</li>
            <li>to serve, rewarm and then top with sauce, pecans, whipped cream, etcet</li>
        </ol>
