        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>so im currently working at this place called the celtic cup. it's like a little celtic themed coffee shop/bistro type beat.
            the food is hella overpriced if im being honest but ya know. anyways our chicken salad is SO bomb. i took a picture of the recipe 
            on the computer and im STEALING it. we serve it on mixed greens or on a tortilla wrap. this shit is so fire. it also makes a 
            <em>huuuuuge</em>batch so if you're making this at home, definitely like. reduce the portion by like half and itll last a family like
            a week or something unless yall REALLY like chicken salad.
