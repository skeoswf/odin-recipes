        <p>i just straight up stole the recipe from where i work at. yanked a picture of that shit from the bosses
            computer in september 2022. yall stay safe out there. is it good?? yes. have i ever made it at home?? no.
            but. i would like to. oh what was that-- you want a description?? it's <em>beyond</em> description. words cannot do justice
            to the taste sensations culminating on your tongue. from this. irish. lamb. stew. but in all seriousness it's pretty decent.
